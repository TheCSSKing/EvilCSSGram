# Evil CSS-Gram

A tiny library for recreating Instagram filters from a hell-dimension (with apologies to [CSS-Gram](https://una.im/CSSgram/)).

[View The Demo](https://thecssking.github.io/EvilCSSGram/demo/) or [Download v1.0](https://github.com/thecssking/MoreObnoxiousCSS/releases/download/v1.0/moreobnoxious.css)

## Usage Instructions

1.  Download the most recent version of the library and add it to your page.
2.  Attach desired filter class to the image as a class.  View the demo site to see available filters.
3.  (Optional) Bathe computer in holy water.

The CSS Filter property applies to all children - so you can also attach the filter class to a containing div or figure element.  For extra fun, try putting an evil filter on the body element.  

**note**: A few filters use CSS transforms as well - those might not work as well on containing elements.

## TODO

As always, there are a million related things to try.

* Experiment with background-blend-mode filters.
* SVG Filters!
* Better tooling for generating complex filters.  Even some of [the better](https://cssgenerator.org/filter-css-generator.html) tools don't allow you to stack or re-arrange the order.  A better tool could be very useful for the three people on the planet busy building CSS filter libraries.
